After spending 15 years as a kindergarten teacher, helping young minds grow and discover their potential, Iâ€™m now on an exciting journey into the world of programming. This career shift feels like a new beginning, one where I can bring my creativity, patience, and problem-solving skills into a fresh context. I live in Kibbutz Zorea with my three wonderful children, a playful dog, and three cats who keep life lively and full of love. Embracing this challenge has been a rewarding experience, and I look forward to blending my background in education with my new technical skills to make a meaningful impact.
